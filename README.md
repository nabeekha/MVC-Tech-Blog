# <MVC-Tech-Blog>

## Description

This application is a blog where software developers can post articles and other users can reply with comments. This is being created with several technologies within an MVC structure. Primarily, the application uses a front-end consisting of HTML, CSS and Javascript with Handlebars. The backend infrastructure contains several routes that are connected to a MySQL database using Sequelize. Interconnectivity is created using Node.js. I built this application to improve my ability to create full-stack software suites.
